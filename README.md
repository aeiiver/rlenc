# rlenc

It's supposed to be a run-length encoding library but actually turns out it was
more like an experiment towards writing libraries. I would consider this library
as unstable.

### Testing

Bootstrap the build:

```sh
cc -o m ./uu.c
```

Build and test:

```sh
./m && ./test
```

### License

MIT License or Public Domain, whichever fits your requirements. See more
information at the end of `./rlenc.h`.
